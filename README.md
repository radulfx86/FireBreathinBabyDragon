Playground for PirateSoftwares GameJam14

Use it to test code snippets/examples/proof-of-concept

The initial setup is taken directly from the raylib-repositories

# Build
initially, go to the build-directory and call "cmake ..". This will download and compile the dependencies (raylib).

Then build with "make" (while still in the build-directory)

# Setup
create a path "images" and place the files from the google-drive there directly.

# Run
run from the main directory with build/raylib_playground
